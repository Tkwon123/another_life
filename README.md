Alas, life is not always so interesting. Why spend time here when you could be living elsewhere! *another life* brings you into the lens of somewhere else doing something better (why else would it be posted online!).

Utilizes [Google's Geociding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/)along with [Instagram's API](https://instagram.com/developer/) to pull the latest photos of a given location. If you want your own local deployment, you'll need to register your app with Instagram and fill your credentials in the secrets.yml file.
